Step 1: Open port in firewall
$ sudo ufw enable 
$ sudo ufw allow 8000

Step 2: Determine local IP address
$ ifconfig

Look for your "inet_addr" for the appropriate network adapter. For this example, I'm on 192.168.0.5.

Step 3: Start Django development server

$ python manage.py runserver 192.168.0.5:8000

Step 4: Access site on mobile browser

The key here is to make sure that your mobile device is connected to your local wi-fi network. This obviously won't work if the device is connected to the cellular network without a VPN or some other trickery. Once you're on wi-fi, you can point your mobile browser to '192.168.0.5:8000' and access your app!
